This is a rewriting of a Windows Mobile project I wrote for my own personal use, since I have
recently switched from Windows Mobile to Android.

I am using Monodroid since I'm not good at Java, and I couldn't get PhoneGap to work right.
Also, I can (partly) reuse the libraries I created for the Windows Mobile app.

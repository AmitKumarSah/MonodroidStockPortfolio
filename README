Monodroid Stock Portfolio
=========================

What...? Why...?
----------------

This is a rewriting of a Windows Mobile project I wrote for my own personal use, since I have
recently switched from Windows Mobile to Android.

I am using Monodroid since I'm not good at Java, and I couldn't get PhoneGap to work right.
Also, I can (partly) reuse the libraries I created for the Windows Mobile app.

By hosting this project on github, I will be providing this app as an open-source app for other
Monodroid devs to learn from, as well as help myself learn how to use git.

Notes
-----

I originally used db4o for the persistence of this app, but since the Mono version of db4o seems to
be a bit behind, and it also seems a little silly to run a conversion of a conversion on top of
another conversion, so I just switched it over to using Sqlite, since it's not that complex of a
domain anyway.

To get stock quotes, I'm using a Yahoo API coupled with the FileHelpers library
(since the Yahoo API outputs a CSV)
